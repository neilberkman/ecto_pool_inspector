# EctoPoolInspector

## WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

This library is completely untested in real-world scenarios and may contain bugs that could impact your database connections. Use at your own risk. Not recommended for production use.

## Overview

EctoPoolInspector provides real-time visibility into Ecto connection pool usage in production Elixir applications. When database connection pools become exhausted, this library captures point-in-time snapshots showing which processes hold connections, their stack traces, hold durations, and application context.

The library is cluster-aware, providing aggregated views across all nodes.

## Features

- Real-time connection tracking via DBConnection telemetry
- Automatic snapshot capture based on configurable triggers (pool saturation, queue time)
- Configurable stack trace sampling
- Cluster-aware snapshot aggregation
- Context detection for Phoenix requests, Oban jobs, Broadway processors, GenServer calls, and Tasks
- Nested transaction depth tracking
- Rate limiting and configurable sampling

## Installation

Add `ecto_pool_inspector` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ecto_pool_inspector, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Configuration

Configure in your `config/config.exs` or `config/runtime.exs`:

```elixir
config :ecto_pool_inspector,
  repos: [
    %{
      # The Ecto repo to monitor
      repo: MyApp.Repo,

      # Application name for telemetry events (required)
      app_name: :my_app,

      # Trigger conditions for automatic snapshots
      triggers: [
        {:pool_saturation, 0.8},  # Trigger at 80% pool usage
        {:queue_time, :p95, 200, :millisecond}  # Trigger on high queue time
      ],

      # Stack trace sampling configuration
      capture_stack_traces: :sample,  # :all | :none | :sample
      stack_trace_sample_rate: 0.1,   # Sample 10% when :sample mode
      stack_trace_timeout: 100,        # ms per stack capture
      stack_trace_concurrency: 10,     # Max concurrent captures

      # Snapshot storage configuration
      max_snapshots: 50,  # Keep last 50 snapshots per node

      # Monitoring intervals
      saturation_poll_interval: 10_000,  # Check saturation every 10s
      snapshot_interval: 60_000,         # Min time between auto snapshots

      # Pool configuration (if not in repo config)
      pool_size: 10
    }
  ]
```

### Multiple Repos

You can monitor multiple repos by adding multiple configurations:

```elixir
config :ecto_pool_inspector,
  repos: [
    %{
      repo: MyApp.Repo,
      app_name: :my_app,
      triggers: [{:pool_saturation, 0.8}],
      capture_stack_traces: :sample,
      pool_size: 10
    },
    %{
      repo: MyApp.ReadReplica,
      app_name: :my_app,
      triggers: [{:pool_saturation, 0.9}],  # Higher threshold for read replica
      capture_stack_traces: :none,  # No stack traces for read replica
      pool_size: 20
    }
  ]
```

## Setup

Add to your application supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyApp.Repo,
      {EctoPoolInspector, []},  # Must come AFTER repos
      # ... other children
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

## Usage

### Manual Snapshot Capture

```elixir
# Capture snapshot on all nodes
EctoPoolInspector.capture_snapshot(MyApp.Repo, :all, :manual_debug)

# Capture on local node only (faster)
EctoPoolInspector.capture_snapshot(MyApp.Repo, :local, :investigating_issue)

# Capture on specific nodes
nodes = [:"app@prod-1", :"app@prod-2"]
EctoPoolInspector.capture_snapshot(MyApp.Repo, nodes, :targeted_debug)
```

### Viewing Snapshots

```elixir
# Get latest snapshot from all nodes
EctoPoolInspector.latest_snapshot(MyApp.Repo, :all)
|> EctoPoolInspector.format_snapshot()

# List recent snapshots
EctoPoolInspector.list_snapshots(MyApp.Repo, :all, limit: 5)
```

### Example Output

## Deployment Strategy (If You Ignore The Warning Above)

### Phase 1: Passive Monitoring

Start with minimal overhead:

```elixir
config :ecto_pool_inspector,
  repos: [
    %{
      repo: MyApp.Repo,
      app_name: :my_app,
      capture_stack_traces: :none,  # Just counts
      saturation_poll_interval: 30_000,  # Low frequency
      triggers: [
        {:pool_saturation, 0.95}  # High threshold
      ]
    }
  ]
```

### Phase 2: Selective Stack Traces

After validating Phase 1:

```elixir
capture_stack_traces: :sample,
stack_trace_sample_rate: 0.05,  # 5% sampling
triggers: [
  {:pool_saturation, 0.85}  # Lower threshold
]
```

### Phase 3: Full Production

```elixir
capture_stack_traces: :sample,
stack_trace_sample_rate: 0.1,
triggers: [
  {:pool_saturation, 0.8},
  {:queue_time, :p95, 200, :millisecond}
]
```

## Testing

### Simulating Pool Exhaustion

The library includes test helpers for simulating pool exhaustion:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PoolTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  alias EctoPoolInspector.TestHelper

  test "captures snapshot when pool is exhausted" do
    # Exhaust the pool
    tasks = TestHelper.exhaust_pool(MyApp.Repo, 8)

    # Capture snapshot
    {:ok, snapshot} = EctoPoolInspector.capture_snapshot(MyApp.Repo, :local, :test)

    # Verify snapshot shows connections
    assert snapshot.total_connections == 8

    # Clean up
    TestHelper.cleanup_tasks(tasks)
  end
end
```

### Alternative Testing Approach

```elixir
# Using transactions instead of direct checkout
tasks = TestHelper.exhaust_pool_with_transactions(MyApp.Repo, 8)
# ... perform tests ...
TestHelper.cleanup_tasks(tasks)
```

## Monitoring the Monitor

Subscribe to telemetry events to monitor the inspector itself:

```elixir
:telemetry.attach(
  "log-inspector-events",
  [:ecto_pool_inspector, :snapshot, :captured],
  fn _event, measurements, metadata, _config ->
    Logger.info("""
    Pool snapshot captured
    Repo: #{inspect(metadata.repo)}
    Reason: #{metadata.reason}
    Connections: #{measurements.connection_count}
    """)
  end,
  nil
)
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Per Node"
        ST[StateTracker Singleton<br/>- Monitors DBConnection events<br/>- Tracks checkout state<br/>- Process monitoring]

        ST --> RM1[RepoMonitor 1<br/>MyRepo]
        ST --> RM2[RepoMonitor 2<br/>ReadRepo]
        ST --> RMN[RepoMonitor N<br/>...]

        RM1 --> S1[Storage.ETS 1]
        RM2 --> S2[Storage.ETS 2]
        RMN --> SN[Storage.ETS N]
    end

    S1 --> API[Public API RPC<br/>Aggregates across nodes]
    S2 --> API
    SN --> API
```

## Design Principles

1. Built on DBConnection telemetry events
2. Cluster-aware snapshot aggregation
3. Rate limiting and configurable sampling to minimize overhead

## Performance Characteristics

- StateTracker Memory: O(n) where n = active connections
- Checkout/Checkin: O(1) with counter cache
- Pool Saturation Check: O(1) with counter cache
- Snapshot Capture: O(m) where m = sampled connections
- Telemetry Overhead: Async cast per query

## Known Limitations

1. Only works with pools that emit DBConnection telemetry
2. Requires at least one query to discover repoâ†’pool mapping
3. Small window where connections might be missed during capture
4. Advanced DBConnection ownership transfer not tracked (rare edge case)
5. Completely untested with real workloads
